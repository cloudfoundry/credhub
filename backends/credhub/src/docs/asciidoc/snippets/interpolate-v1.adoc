== Interpolation Endpoint

=== Interpolate a JSON Object

This endpoint receives a VCAP_SERVICES object containing CredHub references and responds with the object containing the credential values interpolated.

NOTE: At this time, only credential references at `credentials.credhub-ref` will be interpolated.
The key `credhub-ref` will be removed and the referenced credential object will be set as the value of credentials.
