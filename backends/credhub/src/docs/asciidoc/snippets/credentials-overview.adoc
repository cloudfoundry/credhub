=== Overview

Credentials are the primary object in CredHub.
Any passwords, secrets, configurations or other sensitive information that you store is saved to a named credential.
You can retrieve, update and delete a credential using its name.

All credentials, regardless of type, share a common namespace, e.g. a credential named `/diego-tls` exists once in CredHub.
Credential names are not reservable, so two users updating a credential of the same name will result in updates to the same credential.
If you prefer a separate namespace for your credentials, you can add a path prior to the credential name.

Credentials are typed based on the format of the stored value, value validation and generation procedure.
Once a credential type has been set, it cannot be updated to a new type.
If you mistakenly set the type, you must delete the credential, then set it with the correct type.
